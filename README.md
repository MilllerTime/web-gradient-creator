Create gradients from a variety of color spaces and generate a CSS compatible approximation.

The color space you choose to interpolate the values of a gradient can greatly affect the overall result. Because browsers always interpolate in RGB no matter the color format used, this experiment offers a way to simulate CSS gradients in other color spaces by calculating the true gradient in JS and sampling the interpolated values to produce a similar effect in RGB. This can provide more creative freedom with gradients on the web.
